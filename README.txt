1.Model.py : This is a saved ML model which uses SVM to classify the images of single parking spot, as either empty/not-empty.
              Later on we used this model on the aerial view of video of a parking lot to detect empty parking spots.

2.Spots_extract for model.py : In this file we show how the images/data for training of our model.py was done
