#Parking_Spot_locator

## 1.Model.py :
                This is a saved ML model which uses SVM to classify the images of single parking spot, as either empty/not-empty.
                Later on we used this model on the aerial view of video of a parking lot to detect empty parking spots.

## 2.Spots_extract for model.ipynb : 
                                  In this file we show how the images/data for training of our model.py was extracted from the single parking lot image.
